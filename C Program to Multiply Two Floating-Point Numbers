In this example, the product of two floating-point numbers entered by the user is calculated and printed on the screen.

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    double a, b, product;
    printf("Enter two numbers: ");
    scanf("%lf %lf", &a, &b);  
 
    // Calculating product
    product = a * b;

    // %.2lf displays number up to 2 decimal point
    printf("Product = %.2lf", product);
    
    return 0;
}

OUTPUT
Enter two numbers: 2.4
1.12
Product = 2.69

HOW IT WORKS

In this program, the user is asked to enter two numbers which are stored in variables a and b respectively.
Then, the product of a and b is evaluated and the result is stored in product.
Finally, product is displayed on the screen using printf().
Notice that, the result is rounded off to the second decimal place using %.2lf conversion character
