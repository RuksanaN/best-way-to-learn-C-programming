In this example, you will learn to find the quotient and remainder when an integer is divided by another integer.

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int dividend, divisor, quotient, remainder;
    printf("Enter dividend: ");
    scanf("%d", &dividend);
    printf("Enter divisor: ");
    scanf("%d", &divisor);

    // Computes quotient
    quotient = dividend / divisor;

    // Computes remainder
    remainder = dividend % divisor;

    printf("Quotient = %d\n", quotient);
    printf("Remainder = %d", remainder);
    return 0;
}

Output
Enter dividend: 25
Enter divisor: 4
Quotient = 6
Remainder = 1 

HOW IT WORKS
In this program, the user is asked to enter two integers (dividend and divisor). They are stored in variables dividend and divisor respectively.
Then the quotient is evaluated using / (the division operator), and stored in quotient.
Similarly, the remainder is evaluated using % (the modulo operator) and stored in remainder.
Finally, the quotient and remainder are displayed using printf().
